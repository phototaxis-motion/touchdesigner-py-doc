        "content": "[edit] Consider the following module, used as an extension in a component called comp1 for example class MyClass:\n\tdef __init__(self):\n\t\tself.Scale = 5 Any expressions that reference Scale will not update when Scale is manually changed. For example, if either of these expressions was in the value field of a Constant CHOP, it would not be updated if the Scale value was updated. Example: # using a non-promoted extension\nop('comp1').ext.MyClass.Scale\n\n# using a promoted extension\nop('comp1').Scale If you need your references to dynamically update, you can create a Dependency. Start by defining a tdu.Dependency as below: class MyClass:\n\tdef __init__(self):\n\t\tself.Scale = tdu.Dependency(5) Now there is a cook dependency created between the Scale value, and the Operator referencing it. There are two ways to reference the value. The first is similar to how we were referencing the value previous: # using a non-promoted extension\nop('comp1').ext.MyClass.Scale\n\n# using a promoted extension\nop('comp1').Scale and the other method is to explicitly call the Scale's val: # use for non-promoted extension\nop('comp1').ext.MyClass.Scale.val\n\n# use for a promoted extension\nop('comp1').Scale.val Note the .val is often not required, as the Dependency object will cast itself to its underlying value in most cases. To update this value, you must reference the member's val. A Dependency value is a type in and of itself and writing the expression below would actually overwrite the Dependency value with a regular interger and remove the cook dependency from the references: # wrong way to update dependency of a promoted extension\nop('comp1').Scale = 5 What you should do instead is assign the value to the val of the Dependency as below: # correct way to update dependency of a promoted extension\nop('comp1').Scale.val = 5 Using this method will update the value of Scale while keeping the Dependency intact. Dictionaries, lists, sets, and other objects with changing contents are called \"mutable\" objects. If the contents of a mutable object changes, a dependency wrapping it does not automatically register as being modified! You must either use a deeply dependable collection or call the .modified() function manually as in the example below: op('comp1').Scale.val = [1,2,3]\nop('comp1').Scale.val[1] = 15 # changing the contents doesn't update dependency!\nop('comp1').Scale.modified() # this call notifies TouchDesigner that the value has changed You can create Python callbacks that are called when the dependency object changes: op('comp1').Scale.callbacks = [print]\n\n# adding a function requires getting the list, changing it, then re-setting it\ndef prevPrint(info):\n\tprint(f'Previous value: {info['prevVal']})\n    \ncallbacks = op('comp1').Scale.callbacks\ncallbacks.append(prevPrint)\nop('comp1').Scale.callbacks = callbacks\n\n# removing a callback works similarly\ncallbacks = op('comp1').Scale.callbacks\ncallbacks.remove(print)\nop('comp1').Scale.callbacks = callbacks TouchDesigner Build: Latest\\nwikieditorwikieditor2022.241402021.100002018.28070before 2018.28070"
